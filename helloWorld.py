# Modified the program to accept input from the user
name = input("Enter your name: ")


# adding a new input
# Now adapted so that only an integer can be entered
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# print

print( "Hello, ", name, "you are so old at: ", age, "years.")




# removed the print function of name
# created input for age
# print saying hello to user, and mention their age
